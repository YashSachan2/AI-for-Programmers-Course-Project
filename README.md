## Robust Unsupervised StyleGAN Image Restoration

Enhanced a CVPR 2023 unsupervised image restoration framework by upgrading to StyleGAN3-R, using hybrid optimizer schedule and ArcFace-based identity loss for better convergence and facial identity preservation.
Used patience-based early stopping and observed 7% improvement in composed pFID metric.
